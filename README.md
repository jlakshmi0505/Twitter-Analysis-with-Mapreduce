# Twitter-Analysis-with-Mapreduce
MapReduce paradigm to analyze tweets from the popular Twitter microblogging platform

## Basic Analysis

### Find the users that tweet the most. To get more interesting results, try to filter out bots and spammers (hmm, what is a good way to do this?). Who are the top 5 users and what do they tweet about? When do they tweet, where are they located (timezone?) etc.?

### How have hashtags trended over time? Find the top 5 hashtags for each week in the dataset, and then build a histogram for each hashtag to show its usage frequency over the entire 6-month span. You should be able to see that some hashtags die out quickly while others are “stickier.”

### Apply sentiment analysis to calculate the overall sentiment associated with the users and the hashtags from the previous questions. Is a particular hashtag frequently associated with negativity or positivity? Find an interesting way to present your findings.
